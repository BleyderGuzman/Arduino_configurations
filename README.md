# Arduino packages
Configurations of Olimex boards that can be loaded by the Arduino board manager.
  
This repository contains Arduino package for Olimex boards, libraries and tools.  
  
It is separated in three directories for the three architectures: AVR; PIC; STM. In each of them you can find the *.json file required by Arduino IDE to install the package and also folders with bootloaders for some of the boards, the archives of the different versions of the package; and some of the tools required to upload sketches that aren't supported by default.
